Once the generator's function code reaches a \"yield\" statement, the generator yields its execution back to the for loop, returning a new value from the set.

    "### Iteration Review\n",

    " - Implements an `__iter__` method\n",
    " - Implements a `__next__` method\n",

    "### Generators\n",
    "Generators arrived way back in Python 2.3, from [PEP-255](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/).  This PEP introduced the idea of creating an iterator within a single function by using a single new keyword: `yield`  BUT WAIT you may ask -- \"If iterators must be stateful (so they can know when they are exhausted), how can this be done from a function?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, a GENERATOR allows an ordinary function to store iterator state, AND generate the members of a sequence, one at a time.  This is known as **LAZY EVALUATION**.  The ordinary function is transformed into a generator simply by using the `yield` keyword.  The function does not become a Generator until it is invoked (called).\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Generator**: A function which returns a generator iterator. It looks like a normal function except that it contains `yield` expressions for producing a series of values usable in a for-loop or that can be retrieved one at a time with the `next()` function.<br>\n",
    "Each `yield` temporarily suspends processing, remembering the location execution state (including local variables and pending try-statements). When the generator iterator resumes, it picks up where it left off (in contrast to functions which start fresh on every invocation).\n",
