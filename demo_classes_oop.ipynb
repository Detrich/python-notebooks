    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Example Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Person: \n",
    " - Properties -> Name, Age, Address\n",
    " - Behaviors -> Running, Sleeping, Talking\n",
    "\n",

    " - Properties -> Recipient list, Subject, Body, From\n",
    " - Behaviors -> Send, Add Attachment\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.\n"
