    "\n",
    "- Each block of python code is called a cell.\n",
    "- You are running an actual python program, cell-by-cell.\n",
    "- You can edit and re-run the code cells in place without overwriting the original notebook.\n",
    "- Don't worry about the In [x]: or Out [y]: notations on the left margin.\n",
    "- Variables are remembered between cells.\n",
    "- Don't worry about formatting your output to print everything on a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting your work\n",
    "- Add your python code into each cell to complete the kata.\n",
    "- Select **File -> Download as -> Python (.py)** and save to your local machine.\n",
    "- Submit your .py file into the assignment upload window.\n",
    "- Bonus Pts: Try the same exercises using List Comprehensions. Submit a second .py file.\n",
